# aciv
apply classes in viewport

# how to use
call aiv.init to Start and aiv.kill to end.

aiv.kill(clearFlag, removeAnims)

clearFlag removes classes
removeAnims removes classes (not just Anims, too lazy to change) in data-aiv from Element.

does not discriminate between classes added manually and classes added via data-aiv attrib
